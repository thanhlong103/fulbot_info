            About FulBot
          </Typography>
          <Typography align="center" fontSize={25} gutterBottom>
            FulBot is a student-led research group at Fulbright University Vietnam, supervised by a Ph.D. instructor, 
            dedicated to exploring human-robot interaction (HRI) and autonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments. 
            Our mission is to advance robotics research through collaboration, innovation, and hands-on experimentation.

          <Typography align="center" fontSize={25} gutterBottom>
            We focus on key areas such as socially aware motion planning, human activity recognition, and sensor fusion 
            for real-world robotic applications. By integrating techniques in computer vision, deep learning, and control systems, 
            we develop intelligent robotic systems capable of adapting to complex environments.
            Beyond research, FulBot aims to foster a vibrant robotics community at Fulbright University Vietnam.
